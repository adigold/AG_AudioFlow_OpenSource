# Apple Workflow-Free Alternatives for AG AudioFlow

## Current Situation
- ✅ **CLI Tool**: Pure Node.js + SoX/FFmpeg (no Apple workflows)
- ❌ **Right-click Integration**: Uses Apple Automator workflows

## Alternative Integration Methods (No Apple Workflows)

### 1. **Terminal-Only Usage** (Completely Apple-free)
```bash
# Pure CLI usage - no Apple dependencies
agaudioflow stereo-to-mono audio.mp3
agaudioflow normalize podcast.mp3
agaudioflow volume song.mp3 5
```

### 2. **File Watcher Scripts** (No workflows needed)
```bash
# Watch a folder for new files and auto-process
./watch-folder.sh ~/Desktop/ToProcess/
```

### 3. **Drag & Drop Scripts** (Alternative to right-click)
```bash
# Drag files onto scripts instead of right-clicking
./convert-to-mp3.sh [dragged files]
./normalize-audio.sh [dragged files]
```

### 4. **Third-Party Context Menu Tools**
- **BetterTouchTool** - Custom context menus
- **PopClip** - Text/file selection actions
- **Alfred** - File actions and workflows

### 5. **Browser-Based Interface** (No Apple workflows)
```bash
# Local web interface for file processing
agaudioflow --web-server
# Opens localhost:3000 for drag-and-drop processing
```
